On the <em>other</em> (alternate) days we’ll be reading <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/css-2018/\">CSS Specs</a> alongside the techniques we’ve used.\nThis will also be the day when you’ll create your own task, be it to implement some design of your imagination, or writing a blog post about what you’ve learned to recap and share your knowledge.</p>\n<p>We’ve designed the program this way because we realise reading the specs may have been the most effective way of learning CSS!\nIt gives you a rooting perspective — browser implementation. You are free to trace back to its origin, to understand the challenge and motivation of each CSS feature. And it keeps you updated to the most recent development.</p>\n<p>​​What’s the catch?</p>\n<p>Of course, you will have to work hard for it. Because reading the specs may be a bit daunting at first.</p>\n<p>But once you’ve read a few sections and have understood the basics, you’ll start to enjoy it.\nBecause the feeling of understanding the principles inside-out is simply… Amazing!</p>\n<p>We’ll keep you accompanied, cuz we’re striving to read them, too!!!\nWe’ll also be posting our study notes. We’ll focus on intuition. Hopefully that’ll pave the way for a more thorough understanding of CSS.</p>\n<p>So buckle up!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Hello, Coding Girls (and Guys)!","date":"January 19, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/hello/","previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/guidelines/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Guidelines"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2633910083","3128451518","3649515864"]}
